# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
I like web standards and think they are good because they make basic HTML programming easier.

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
It does, it's user friendly and straightforward.

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
I do like the new HTML5 elements.  Semantics make it easier to follow an HTML document and I like reducing the number of <div> in a document, which can get cluttered. 

* Why is reset.css necessary? 
It reduces browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings.  I found in doing this challenge that it also removes custom fonts - my @font-face font did not work until I commented out the reset.css link in the HTML document.

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

I use Firefox and (occasionally Chrome) at home and have had to use Internet Explorer at work in the past.  I have noticed that sites look different at times (court websites are a good example) and sometimes a website, or aspects of a site, will work in one browser but not in another. I personally find it frustrating when websites don't work across multiple browsers, but don't think I've ever noticed differences significant enough between browsers to upset me.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I used the following for HTML jump to screen and jump to different page syntax, which was not covered in the resources provided: http://www.htmlgoodies.com/tutorials/getting_started/article.php/3479511
