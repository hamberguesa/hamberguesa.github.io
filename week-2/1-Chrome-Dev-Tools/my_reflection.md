# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

DOM is the underlying concept that enables us to create fun, interactive, and dynamic websites.  It defines things about web pages.  To start, it says that a website is a document and within the document are a series of objects (e.g., <p>, <h1>, etc.)  Second, it says that objects are nested inside one another in a way that can be charted in a tree-like structure where each object represents a node/branch on a tree. Third, DOM defines the relationship between different elements in your document - each element can have one parent and many children.  In other words, DOM is a model/map of a webpage that is loaded in a browser.  DOM makes more sense to me as being a map after reading the SkillCrush article and watching the video.  It seems easy to navigate, which is good, but impossible to do anything with/interact with until I know Javascript.

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

My site is quite simple compared to the wordpress.com site (I looked at aprettypennyblog.com).  Also the wordpress site uses Javascript and contains references to Javascript in its HTML.  The wordpress site was larger and took 4.23 seconds to load, while my site took 668 ms.  There weren't many suggestions for performance optimization for my site, but there were for the wordpress site; likely because that site is larger and more complex.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

A pain.  At present, without knowledge of Javascript and without practice using it, Chrome Web Tools is cumbersome.  Also, Chrome is not my browser of choice, so being forced to use it is not optimal. 

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

No.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I had to research on my own what an .md file is and how to upload an inline picture to that kind of file.  I just used Google and a post in stackoverflow for the language.
