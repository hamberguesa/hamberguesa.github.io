    <h1>Introduction to Pair Programming</h1>
    <p>
      Pair programming is a software development technique wherein two programmers work together to produce code.  There are two roles in pair programming - the driver and the navigator.  The driver writes the code while the navigator directs the code being written and reviews each line of code as it is written. It is typical that the driver and the navigator switch roles frequently - even within one session.

  <section id="why">
    <h1>Why is this Important?</h1>
    <p>
      Pair programming is important because it improves design quality and makes problem solving easier.  Two heads are better than one.  Pair programming also facilitates learning and sharing knowledge, whether it be tips regarding programming languages or overall design skill.  Pair programming is also important because it facilitates team building and communication amongst programmers.</p>
    </p>
    <p>Pair programming is important at DBC for the reasons stated above, and because it prepares the boots for positions they will obtain when they enter the workforce as programmers.

      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <p>I did not have a pair partner, so I worked with the instructor.  I enjoyed pair programming, particularly because Lorena gave me some helpful tips and links about certain programming aspects that I did not know before. We did as much as we could in the hour and then I was left to complete the challenge on my own, which involved CSS formatting, a topic I'm still a little shaky on.  I'd say everything worked except that I'm not happy with the placement of the navigation bar (we used a different approach than I'm used to and I can't get it to center).</p>
