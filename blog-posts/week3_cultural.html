			<p>I guess I have always known what my Gregorc learning style was. Heck, when I was little I thought the purpose of playtime was to <i>organize</i> my toys, and you should see my apartment now. And now as I read down the list for concrete sequential learners, it's like a grocery list:  </p> 
				<ul>
					<li>works best in an orderly, quiet environment &#x2713;</li>
					<li>likes to know the accepted way of doing things &#x2713;</li>
					<li>likes clear and exact directions, examples and guided practice &#x2713;</li>
					<li>applies ideas in a practical hands-on way &#x2713;</li>
					<li>is consistent and efficient &#x2713;</li>
					<li>needs and enjoys structured situations &#x2713;</li>
					<li>likes things to be ordered and arranged in specific ways, is a natural organizer &#x2713;</li>
					<li>is always busy, looking for constructive things to do &#x2713;</li>
					<li>prefers to do things step-by-step &#x2713;</li>
					<li>is a natural editor, can take anything and make it better &#x2713;</li>
					<li>and the list goes on...</li>
				</ul>
			<p>But let's not forget the drawbacks to being a concrete sequential learner:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>struggles with making choices &#x2713;</li>
					<li>struggles with open-ended assignments and "what if" questions &#x2713;</li>
					<li>struggles with taking new approaches, interpreting abstract ideas &#x2713;</li>
					<li>has a fear of being wrong &#x2713;</li>
				</ul><br>

			<p><a href="http://www.floatingneutrinos.com/Message/arcs/links_on_abstractrandom.htm"target="_blank">Concrete sequential learners</a> are systematic, instinctual, organized, stable, productive, and perfectionist.  I never knew I could be summed up in <strong>SIX WORDS</strong> so well. And then que Dev Bootcamp - a new approach for one unfamiliar with programming, people-oriented, a situation where I have constantly been wrong and had to re-work challenges, and, at times, free-flowing.  Yikes, right?</p> 
			<p>However, in these first three weeks of Phase 0, I have also found Dev Bootcamp to be stuctured (time limits, step-by-step instructions, examples galore) and efficient (I can learn to program in a few months!?!). Not that I haven't struggled - sometimes the directions are not exact, sometimes there are no examples, and sometimes I just can't take being wrong for another second.  But when things are right, they are <i>so</i> right.  In the end, I think programming will lend itself to my learning style and I will learn to curb my frustrations.</p>
			<p>And how does all this connect with <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/the-habits-of-successful-people-they-have-a-growth-mindset"target="_blank">growth versus fixed mindset?</a> One can have growth mindset in some areas, and fixed mindset in others.  I certainly am one of those people.  I've always been a believer that intelligence can be developed and I <i>love</i> to learn.  That said, when my frustration over reaching the wrong result creeps in like <a href="https://twitter.com/KarlTheFog"target="_blank">Karl the Fog</a>, I tend to edge toward fixed mindset beliefs. Knowing this, however, will (hopefully) lead me to enlightenment, or at least expand the way I learn. I took heart in James Clear's advice: "Confidence is just displayed ability." Small wins are key.  To that end, I have tried to end each day on a positive note and it seems to be working.</p>
			<p>And have no fear.  To those of you worried about working with a concrete sequential - I married a <a href="http://www.floatingneutrinos.com/Message/arcs/links_on_abstractrandom.htm"target="_blank">concrete random</a>, and it was the best thing I ever did!</p>
