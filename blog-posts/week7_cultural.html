			<h1 class="title">What Has Never Been Doubted, Has Never Been Proven</h1>
			<h4 class="date">August 27, 2014</h4>

			<!--Article Begins Here -->
			<h3>Values</h3>

			<p>Accomplishment. Adventure. Ambition. Meaningful relationships. Knowledge. Meaningful work. When I think about the times in my life where I've been the happiest and the most satisfied, these are the values come to mind.</p>

			<p>I feel most satisfied with myself when I am accomplished, or accomplishing something. I can never sit still and am always questioning and challenging myself; striving to learn something new. I guess that ties in ambition and knowledge as well. I don't spend a lot of time pursuing relationships that are superfluous. Thus, the relationships that I have and maintain are <i>very</i> meaningful to me. And I am driven by doing meaningful work. I want to help, not hurt. It's why I left my career as an attorney and am now pursuing programming. That said, I work to live. Adventure has become a driving force in my life. My husband and I have made traveling the world a priority, and I have learned and grown so much from it. It has broadened my horizons and made me more comfortable and satisfied with who I am. I highly recommend traveling!</p>

			<p>DBC asks: In general, I try to live up to these values:</p>
			<p style="text-align:center">Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</p>
			<p>I think this is a silly question, DBC. First, you want us to list the values that result in times that make you the most satisfied and happy. Then, you ask if we try to live up to these values. Why would you not try to live up to those values to your fullest ability? <strong>FIVE</strong> all the way baby!!!</p>

			<h3>Advice</h3>

			<p>The last topic that someone asked for my advice on was wedding related. You see, I'm in a girlfriend's upcoming wedding and we recently went on an epic hunt to find her shoes and other wedding related necessities. How this relates to my values, you ask? I'm fostering a meaningful relationship and using my [fashion] knowledge to help a friend. Woot!</p>

			<h3>Values and The Stereotype Threat</h3>

			<p>Y'all know by now how I feel about the Stereotype Threat, and I can't say that my values and the Stereotype Threat are related in any manner other than that I think it's not okay to ever put yourself down, or limit yourself. As Buddha once said, "The only real failure in life is not to be true to the best one knows."</p>
