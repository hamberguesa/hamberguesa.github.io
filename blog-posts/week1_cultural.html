			<h1 class="title">How Many Cooks in the Kitchen?</h1>
			<h4 class="date">July 20, 2014</h4>

			<!--Article Begins Here -->
			<p>I certainly understand both sides of the restaurant versus kitchen mindset.  It's going to be a learning experience for me in that I've spent years in the restaurant mindset arena of education, particularly in law school where they teach you to regurgitate everything they feed you verbatim.  That said, I can appreciate the kitchen mindset and that DBC wants its students to have a transformational experience. I also find that I learn better when I have an active role in my education and truly engage in the learning process.  I like that it's on me to make the most out of this bootcamp.</p>

			<p>I've presently been struggling with how to deal with my frustration when I get stuck on a problem, as I find myself being overly hard on myself.  I'm looking forward to working more in the peer groups and having that support and an extra brain or two in the mix.  I think once I get more experience with the programs themselves, it'll be easier to navigate through this experience.  I am really excited to get to know more of my peers and a little worried about my own experience level (as Shereef mentioned), but I'm just going to use those nerves to make the most out of this experience and motivate myself!  I'm excited to see if there really <em>can't</em> be too many cooks in the kitchen.</p>
