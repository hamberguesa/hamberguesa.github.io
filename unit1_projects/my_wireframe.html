Plan: I want my web page to reflect the fashion/style blogs that I frequent but be more in the style of a travel/food blog, which is what I spend a lot of my free time doing (eating and traveling).  I like blogs with a simple appearance, not too cluttered, white backgrounds, "hipster" fonts.  Easy navigation - search, top navigation bar, connected links, links that open to another browser window and not in the same window.  I don't often use the side navigation bars on the sites I visit, especially where there is a top nav bar so I may omit that for now on my site.
